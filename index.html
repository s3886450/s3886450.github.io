<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Little Bit About Myself</h2>
<p>I am a 49 year old guy from Adelaide South Australia, up to last week i was employed as a fabricator at iplex Pipelines.
<p>My main role there was to fabricate plastic fittings for the plumbling market and also electricial area.
<p>I was made redundant so i then decided it would like to study for my bachler of IT.

<p>I was born in South Australia and the only language that i speak is English , with some Aussie slang thrown in,
<p>I enjoy tenpin bowling and have had the pleasure of being the captian of the South Australian Team for the last 7 years..</p>

<head>
<h3 style="font-size:30px;">Interested In</h3>
</head>
<p>I have always had an interest in building things and how things work, as phones and even tv's have become smarter i would always wonder how
<p>they work . I would like to be one of those guys that can develope the next big thing , that can help everyone every day.

<p>A friend of mine worked for coles in the IT department and would travel around Australia each week fixing their problems.

<p>I thought i would love a job like that, so that has inspired me into taking the first steps of becoming an IT specialist.

<p>I have no prior knowledge of IT except installing / uninstalling programs on my computer.

<p>I chose to be enrolled at RMIT as i did some research and found that RMIT have the courses that i need to gain knowledge in the IT industry.

<p>What i expect to learn from my subjects , is how the IT industry works and what i can do to better my life working in the field of IT.
<p>I am also enrolled in a programing course so both go hand in hand to better my working career.

<h10 style="font-size:30px;">Results of Social Skills Test</h10>
</head>



<img src="social skill test.jpg"></p>



<p>Going by the results of the Myers Briggs test i am more of a defender, which i find is true.  i will always defend a person if i find that they are correct.
<p>As to my Social Skills it seems that i am more of a recluse and i tend to keep to myself quite a bit, even though i have been in leadership rolls before.
<p>I seem to learn more by visual rather than reading or listening to other people who are teaching the subject, that one thing i will be working on.
<p>When forming a team i will need to find someone who can take the lead roll until i can open up a bit to ask questions, it does not take me long to start talking.</P>

<head>
<h11 style = "font-size:30px;">My Project</h11>

<p>Have you ever walked down a street or been sitting on the bus and saw something you like?
<p>Me too!! That is why iI would like to develope a phone application where you can take a picture on your phone and instantly the application will tell you where to buy it from and how much it will cost you to buy.</p>

<head>
<h12 style = "font-size:30px;"> Let me introduce    PIC-BUY</h12>

<img src="picbuy.png"></p>

<p>Just by taking a picture of something you like with your phone camera using the PIC-BUY application, would save so much time searching the internet or even ebay.  
<p/>You would have all these services right at your fingertips in one application.</p>

<p>My project that i hope to develope would save people so much time, effort and money.
,P.This application would get used by everyday people such as, someone looking for a gift or to just spoil themselves.
<p>The simplicity of just taking a picture then seeing where to buy it from and at what pirice, would suit everyone's lifestyle.</p>

<p>Statistics for 2020 show that an estimated 1.8 billion people world wide purchased goods online.
<p>With the current pandemic 42% of Americans buy their groceries online.
<p>Sales of virus protection related products increased by 807% over the first 10 weeks of 2020, that in itself is outstanding.<p/>

<head>
<h13 style = "font-size:30px;"> What is PIC-BUY ?</h13>

<p>Need a quick and easy way to find the product you would like to buy?
<p>Well look no further, PIC-BUY is a mobile phone or tablet application that will take away all the hard work for you, by simply searching thousands of stores online and retail accross the world.</p>

<p>The PIC-BUY application has an user friendly interface that practally anyone can use with a mobile phone or tablet.
<p>The application interface allows a quick search and comparrison on what ever picture is taken.
<p>It will then give the user a list of places where the product can be purchased and at what cost.</p>

<p>The user downloads the application from the app store or google plat store.
<p>Oncde the application is installed on the moblie device, the user opens the application and enables the location services if they have not already done so.
<p>The user then finds a subject that he or she likes and takes a picture.
within seconds the application then tells the user where to buy it from and how much it will cost them.
<p>It will then be up to the user to either buy the product they like online or at a retail store.
<p>The user can take as many different pictures as they would like and the application with find the products for them instantly.</p>

<p>Discover thousands of retail shops and online shops that you never knew existed.
<p>With PIC-BUY you have the world of buying at your finger tips.
<p>With a simple tap of your mobile phone or tablets camera, you can identify the product and see where to buy it from.</p>

<p>The key features of the PIC-BUY application, is that it is so easy to use.
<p>Search easily for any product that you like in the comfort of your own home, office and even on public transport.
<p>If you are out at the kids soccer game  and you see someone using or wearing an item, simply take a picture and the application will find it for you.
<p>Saves you the hassle of going up to a total stranger and asking where they purchased that item from.
<p>Depending where the item is located, you could be only moments away from owning something you just took a picture of. HOW GOOD IS THAT !!</p>

<p>I have looked into what i will require to make my application a success, apart form the programing knowlwdge that i will need, I would also require some programs such as the following.
<p> : Bulidfire- which is a Java based program which i would use to write most of the codes that i need to run the application.
<p> : Xamarin- is microsoft owned, it can be used to develope ios and android applications for mobile devices.

<p>I feel that the skills that i would need to make my application a reality would be some programing knowledge and skills in IT it self. 
<p>I could choose the easy path and just pay a developer to produce my application, but where is the fun in that right.
<p>Some of the software that i would need for my application to succeed would consist of the following.
<p> : Bulid Fire, which is an application builder.
<p> : Mobile Angular UI a mobile application developement tool.
<p> : Corona Labs, which is used for building 2D graphics.

<p>If my project is successful, people will be able to shop differently from what they are use to now.
<p>Not only will my application save the hassle of searching thousands of pages and shops, both online and instore for the products that they would like.
<p>Just by taking a picture form your mobile device they will be able to find out where to purchase it from and at what cost to them, it would make everyone's life just that little bit easier.
<p>My application would impact the way people search and buy products online and instore, its a WIN WIN for all consumers.
